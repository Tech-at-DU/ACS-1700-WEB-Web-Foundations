Try Smooth scroll. Look at the sample code provided [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-lesson-14/tree/main/smoothscroll-waypoints). Copy this code, _Don't copy and paste!_ Read the code and type it out yourself line by line. 

It's okay to use this code. You need read it line by line. Writing the code out line by line will give you a chance to conside each line as you go. Try these ideas: 

- Add some comments explainging the code to yourself as you go. 
- Ask yourself what is happening at each. When code makes a reference to a an HTML element go find that element. 
- When you see something you don't understand do your best to look it up. Discuss it with someone else.

Try out way points. Take a look at the sample code [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-lesson-14/tree/main/smoothscroll-waypoints).. You can copy this copy this code, don't copy paste, instead write the code by hand, line by line. This will give you a chance to read and consider each line.
