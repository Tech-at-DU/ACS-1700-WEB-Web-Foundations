# Event Delegation

Event Delegation is the idea of using a single listener to handle events from many different elements.

Event delegation is important when you have pages that create dynamic content. Event delegation offers the following advanatges: 

- Only one event and one handler handle events
- Saves computing resources since there will only be one listener
- Prevents memory leaks

Event Delegation takes advantage of event bubbling. Event Bubbling is the process of passing an event from child to parent. To understand event bubbling take a look at this page: https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing

JavaScript.info is a great site the examples are very good. They also have a page on Event Delegation. Take a look at it here: https://javascript.info/event-delegation

Take a look at this example to experiment with event delegation yourself:

## Lab Time

Use today to review your work. Choose What you want to do:

**Option 1:**

Work on the current assignment: Single Page Site. Continue your work at your own pace. 

Read the Rubric for the assignment [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-Web-Foundations/blob/master/Assignments/05-Single-Page-Site.md#assessing-the-assignment)

- Show your work to someone else for feedback. 
- Consider tackling the stretch challenges.

**Option 2**

Try Smooth scroll. Look at the sample code provided [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-lesson-14/tree/main/smoothscroll-waypoints). Copy this code, _Don't copy and paste!_ Read the code and type it out yourself line by line. 

It's okay to use this code. You need read it line by line. Writing the code out line by line will give you a chance to conside each line as you go. Try these ideas: 

- Add some comments explainging the code to yourself as you go. 
- Ask yourself what is happening at each. When code makes a reference to a an HTML element go find that element. 
- When you see something you don't understand do your best to look it up. Discuss it with someone else. 

**Option 3**

Try out way points. Take a look at the sample code [here](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-1700-lesson-14/tree/main/smoothscroll-waypoints).. You can copy this copy this code, don't copy paste, instead write the code by hand, line by line. This will give you a chance to read and consider each line.
